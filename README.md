# :hand: Hi, I'm @vikram-kangotra.
## :computer: About Me
### As a computer enthusiast, I have a deep passion for delving into the intricacies of computer science. My interests span the spectrum of the field, from low-level assembly programming and operating system development to the cutting-edge of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
### I am driven to push the boundaries of what is possible and am constantly seeking new challenges, whether it be creating my own programming language or building AI models from scratch. I am driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to understand the inner workings of technology and to harness its power to solve complex problems.
